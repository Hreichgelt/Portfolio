        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p class="intro"> 
            Hello, my name is Hans Reichgelt. I recently started the Coding Bootcamp and UNC-Charlotte.
            I spent the last 15+ years working in outdoor education, recreation, and land management. That is what my
            undergraduate education is in as well. I live for recreation, especially travel and adventure tourism. I am
            hoping to travel abroad more in the coming years, but have been to 9 countries so far. I  am looking for a career that allows me to work remotely so that I can explore, learn create and bring those experiences to life via my work, and share them with the world.

        <h2>Brand Statement</h2>
        <p class="brandStatement"> 
            Full-stack web developer leveraging recreation tourism and land-management background to build a more inclusive experience for recreation seekers and tourists. Currently earning a certificate in full-stack development from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte Coding Bootcamp. Current skills include; HTML CSS, JavaScript, APIs, JSON and Jquery. 
            Throughout my previous career I have developed the reputation as a visionary professional with the ability to develop a wide range of programs, independently learn new skills and lead projects from start to finish. I recently I learned the ins and outs of adobe creative cloud and would like to continue working with creative projects like that. I am a well-rounded team player with the capacity to quickly learn and become a crucial member of any project assigned. So far in my development journey I have worked both independently and in groups to create interactive and historic mapping projects, random password generators and more. Perhaps most important, I am a resilient individual with a dynamic growth mindset and the ability to resolve complex and controversial issues involving diverse viewpoints and interests; able to adapt communication and leadership style to achieve quality results. I am excited to leverage my skills in a new field as a part of a creative goal oriented team to provide opportunities and ideas for all.
